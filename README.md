## Edge Video Analytics Microservice

This repository contains the source code for Edge Video Analytics Microservice (EVAM) used for the [Video Analytics Use Case](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/video-analytics-service.html). For information on how to build the use case, refer to the [Get Started](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/video-analytics-service.html#inpage-nav-3) guide.

### Build the base image

Complete the following steps to build the base image:

1. Run the following command:
  
   ```sh
     `docker-compose -f  docker-compose-build.yml  build`
   ```

2. If required, download the pre-built container image for Edge Video Analytics Microservice from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/edge_video_analytics_microservice).

### Run the base image

Complete the following steps to run the base image:

1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/intel/edge-video-analytics-microservice).
2. Run the following command to make the following files executable:

   ```sh
    chmod +x tools/model_downloader/model_downloader.sh docker/run.sh
   ```

3. Download the required models. From the cloned repo, run the following command:

   ```sh
   ./tools/model_downloader/model_downloader.sh  --model-list <Path to model-list.yml>
   ```

4. After downloading the models, you will have the `models` directory in the base folder. Refer to the following:

   ```json
    models/
    ├── action_recognition
    ├── audio_detection
    ├── emotion_recognition
    ├── face_detection_retail
    ├── object_classification
    └── object_detection
   ```

5. Add the following lines in the `docker-compose.yml` environment if you are behind a proxy.

   ```sh
    - HTTP_PROXY=<IP>:<Port>/
    - HTTPS_PROXY=<IP>:<Port>/
    - NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```

6. Run the `sudo docker-compose up` command.
